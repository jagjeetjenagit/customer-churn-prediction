# Customer Churn Prediction Project

A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for binary classification, specifically designed for data science beginners. We predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their demographic and service usage patterns.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (via Kaggle Hub)
- **Features**: 21 features including demographics, services, and account information
- **Target**: Churn (Yes/No)
- **Size**: ~7,000 customer records

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Python 3.13.7**
- **Core Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: LogisticRegression, RandomForest, XGBoost
- **Class Balancing**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit web app
- **Model Persistence**: joblib

## 🚀 Key Features

### Data Analysis
- Comprehensive EDA with distribution analysis
- Data quality checks (missing values, data types)
- Feature correlation analysis

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- ColumnTransformer for preprocessing
- Multiple model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Class imbalance handling with SMOTE
- Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
- Feature importance analysis

### Model Deployment
- Saved model artifacts for production use
- Interactive Streamlit web application
- Real-time prediction with probability scores

## 🎯 Model Performance

- **Best Model**: XGBoost Classifier
- **Accuracy**: ~80% on test set
- **ROC-AUC**: Strong performance on imbalanced dataset
- **Feature Importance**: Monthly charges and tenure are key predictors

## 🌐 Web Application

### 🚀 Live Demo
**[Try the live app on Streamlit Cloud!](https://customer-churn-prediction-jagjeetjenagit.streamlit.app)**

### 📊 Two Applications Available

1. **Churn Prediction App** (`churn_app.py`)
   - Interactive customer churn prediction
   - 18 input features for accurate predictions
   - Real-time probability scores

2. **Analysis Dashboard** (`dashboard.py`) - **NEW!** 📈
   - Comprehensive data insights and visualizations
   - Model performance metrics and comparisons
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Business impact calculator and ROI projections
   - Customer segmentation and priority matrix

### Local Setup
Run the Streamlit apps locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the prediction app
streamlit run churn_app.py

# Or run the analysis dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The app provides:
- Interactive input form with 18 customer features
- Real-time churn prediction
- Probability scores for decision confidence
- Professional UI for business users

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Monthly charges** and **tenure** are the strongest predictors of churn
2. **Contract type** significantly impacts customer retention
3. **Class imbalance** (SMOTE) improved minority class detection

## 🚧 Next Steps

1. Feature engineering with tenure buckets and charge ratios
2. Advanced ensemble methods (Voting, Stacking)
3. Model interpretability with SHAP values
